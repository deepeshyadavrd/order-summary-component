## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.plan-box {
  background-color: var(--very-pale-blue);
  border-radius: 12px;
  display: flex;
  padding: 20px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to do more mobile first projects to practice more CSS and do JavaScript. Will continue Frontend Mentor challenges to improve HTML and CSS.
